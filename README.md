#Background 
As the new Chief Data Scientist of the PyCity School District, I was tasked with helping the school board and other city officals with making strategic decisions regarding future district budget and priorities. 

My task was to analyze the district standardized test data and other school information to showcase obvious trends based on the performance of the individual school. 

#Observable District Trends 
 - The dataset is comprised of a total of 15 schools, 39,170 students between a mix of Charter and District school.  The total students average reading score is 81.87 which is higher than the average math score 78.98. When we see the passing rate reading (85.80%) has a higher rate than math (74.98 % ),the overall passing rate is 65.17%. These findings indicate that students have stronger scores in reading than math. 
- Out of the 15 schools in this area, 8 are classified as Charter schools and 7 are District run schools. In terms of student population, Holden High School has the smallest at 427 students while Bailey High School tops out at 4976 students. Based on this data, we can infer that typically Charter schools have smaller populations than District schools. This could be due to the overall geographical size of the area that these schools are in. 
- It can also be noted that the average math scores/passing rate, reading scores/passing rate, and overall passing rate is higher at Charter schools than District schools. This can be attributed to the smaller student population sizes of those types of schools which translates to smaller class sizes. Many studies on student performance and achievement in the classroom have shown that smaller class sizes are better for students as the teacher is able to give more individualized attention to each student.
